       learning repository
       Supposes that there is a mix of data types :
           numeric and categorical

Usage:
    python3 multiple_datatypes_deep_learning_keras_uci.py


Code for all catgeorical data types (use this version)
is 
all_categorical_deep_learning_keras_uci.py

python3 all_categorical_deep_learning_keras_uci.py
